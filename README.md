$ nano .env # Fill in the neccessary environment variables
$ npm build
$ pm2 start pm2.json
```

## Translation

New language contributions are welcome! They are handled through [Crowdin]. If you don't see your language listed, that
means it's likely not supported by the Discord client itself, meaning translations would be pointless. If a language is
available in Discord's setting but is not listed on Crowdin, or you want to help with the translations of an existing
language, please [join our Discord server] and ask for your language to be added to the project in
the [#translator-signup] channel. You will be given the Translator role and granted access to a language-specific
channel for further discussion. This is necessary so that when new translations are needed for any potential new bot
features, I have an easy way to reach everyone at once.

English and Hungarian translations have been included, so no translators will be needed for these two languages.
